# E-commerce Sales EDA

## Data source
Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zahranusratt/e-commerce-orders-and-sales-performance-dataset

## What this project is
I explored an e-commerce sales dataset to understand what drives sales and profit. I looked at sales and profit by category and region, and I also checked how sales changes over time.

## What I found (quick summary)
- Sales are not all the same size. Most orders are smaller, but a few are much bigger.
- Some categories bring in more total sales than others.
- Some regions generate more profit than others.
- Sales and profit usually move together, but not perfectly.
- Monthly sales changes over time, so some months look stronger than others.

## Files in this repo
- `DataAnalyis_eCommerce.ipynb` → the main notebook with my analysis
- `DataAnalyis_eCommerce.html` → exported HTML version of the notebook
- `DataAnalyis_eCommerce.md` → exported Markdown version of the notebook (uses the PNG images in the repo)

## Notes
- The raw dataset (CSV) is not included in this repo. It is kept locally and ignored using `.gitignore`.
- The Markdown version uses image files like `output_*.png` to display the charts on GitHub.
